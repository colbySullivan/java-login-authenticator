# java_login_authenticator

Simple login window in Java that searches an existing database of accounts and returns if the accounts exist. Users can also add to this data base using the signup button.
In future updates I plan to add some new features and a better system for saving credentials.
## Disclaimers

There is no account for security in this program as user accounts are stored in an unencrypted text file.

## Installing

Java is already installed in GitHub codespaces. You can install Java on your personal system using either of these links:

[From Oracle](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/downloads/)

[Open JDK](https://openjdk.java.net/)

## Running
If using Eclispe then use the build button.

In the command line execute the following commands to compile and run.

```
javac main.java
java main
```
